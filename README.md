# Description

Ever wanted to just download the entirety of UP Diliman's class schedules from the past and present? Well, here you've got that. Personally, I use this to see if there are any professors that only take certain time slots to "bypass" the CONCEALED thing.

The first, simply downloads every year specified (Read the .py file) and all letters as separate HTML files. For example, of the year 2000-2001, 1st semester, letter B, this would be saved as 2000-2001 1-B.

The second, downloads each year as a folder, wherein you can then use index.html within the folder to navigate the year through clicks and all. That is, you're able to click through the letters yourself.

# Installation

1. Install Python

2. Install the requirements using the following command while your terminal/command prompt window is in the same folder as the requirements.txt.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. 

# Usage

Open whichever scraper you want. First version is titled crs-scraper.py, second is titled crs-scraper-2.0.py

# Note

Now obviously, the scraping can take some time.
